The IT giant 'SoftCompInfo' has decided to transfer its message through the network using a new encryption technique. The company has decided to encrypt the data using the non-prime number concept. The message is in the form of a number and the sum of non-prime digits present in the message is used as the encryption key.
 
Write an algorithm to determine the encryption key. 

Input 
The input consists of an integer - numMessage, representing the numeric form of the message. 

Output 
Print an integer representing the encryption key

Constraints
0 <  numMessage <= 10^9

Note
Digit 1 and 0 are considered as prime number

Example
Input
45673

Output
10

Explanation
