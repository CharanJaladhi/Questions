The bank SafeMoney had some dormant accounts.  The bank charges certain monthly rates for the maintenance of these accounts.  Because of these monthly deductions, the balance of some of these accounts are negative.  The bank wishes to close these negative value dormant accounts 

Write an algorithm to help the bank find the number of dormant bank accounts that have a negative balance

Input
The first line of the input consists of an integer numOfAccounts,  representing the number of dormant account (N)

The second line consists of N space separated integers ac1, ac2, â€¦ acN  representing the balance in each account

Output
Print an integer representing the number of dormant accounts that must be closed for nagative balance

Constraints
0<= numOfAccounts<=10^6
-1006 <= balance <= 1006
0 <= i < numOfAccounts

Example
Input
10
-5 -3 8 -6 -7 18 10 -4 -3 11

Output
6

Explanation
The accounts that must be closed for negative balance are at indices [0,1,3,4,7,8] i.e [-5, -3, -6, -7, -4, -3]
So, the output is 6
