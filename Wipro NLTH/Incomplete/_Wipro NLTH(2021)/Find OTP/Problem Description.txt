An E-Commerce site wishes to enhance its ordering process.  They plan to implement a new scheme of OTP( one time password)  generation for order confirmation. The OTP can be any number of digits.  For OTP generation the user will be asked to enter two Random numbers.  The first number entered should always be smaller than the second number.  The OTP is calculated as the sum of maximum and the minimum Prime values in the range of the user entered numbers

Write an algorithm to find the OTP 

Input
The input consists of two  space separated integers - first number and second number representing the two numbers entered by the user.  Both numbers are considered in the range

Output
Print an integer representing the sum of the largest and smallest prime numbers in the range of given numbers 

Constraints
-10^9 <= firstNumber < secondNumber <= 10^9

Example
Input
-97 50

Output
50

Explanation
The smallest and largest prime numbers within the given numbers are -97 and 47, respectively
The sum of -97 and 47 is 50
So, the output is 50
