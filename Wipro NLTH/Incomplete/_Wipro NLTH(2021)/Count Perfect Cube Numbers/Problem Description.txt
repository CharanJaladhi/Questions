The children's toy making company "ToysFun" is building cubic shaped learning toys. The company has a list of N dimensions suggested by its designers but they wish to choose only those dimensions for the toys that are perfect cube numbers. To do this, they need to know the total count of perfect cube numbers present in the list of dimensions. 

Write an algorithm to help the toy manufacturers find the total count of perfect cube numbers present in the list of dimensions 

Input
The first line of input consists of an integer - numDimensions representing the total number of dimensions selected by the designers (N).

The second line of input consists of N space separated - dimens1, dimens2, ... , dimenN-1 representing the value of the dimensions selected by the designers

Output
Print an integer value representing the total count of the dimensions that are perfect cube numbers

Constraint
0<numDimensions<=10^6
0<dimens1<10^6
0<=i<numDimensions

Example
9
23 1 8 56 27 67 64 125 232

Output
5

Explanation
The cube numbers are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125. Hence the output is 5
