A company provides data encryption to its client data. The data sent over the network is in the form of a string. The encryption Algorithm used by the company adds a key value in the ascii value of each character of the data string and forms the encrypted string. This string is then sent over the network to provide security 

Write an algorithm to find the encrypted data string

Input 
The first line of the input consists of an integer - key, representing the key value for the encryption 
The second line consists of a string - dataStr, representing the data String to be encrypted 

Output
Print a string representing the encrypted data string 

Constraints
0 < len <= 1000, len is the length of the given data string dataStr 
0 <= key <= 100 

Note 
The dataStr can contain lowercase and uppercase English letters (i.e a-z, A-Z) digits (i.e 0-9), and any special symbols 

Example
Input
3
as3gAsd

Output
dv7jDvg

Explanation
After adding 3 in the ascii value of the characters in the data string, the encrypted string becomes dv7jDvg
