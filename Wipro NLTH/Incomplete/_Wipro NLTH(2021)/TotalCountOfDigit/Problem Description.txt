The online math  course provider mathAtTip has designed a course for children called learning number recognition and counting. The assessment part of the course has a question where the student is given a number and a digit. The student need to find out the total count of the digit present in the number excluding the given digit

Write an algorithm to help the student find out the count of the total number of digits present in the number excluding the given digit.

Input
The input consists of two separated integers - number and digit, where the first integer represents the number and the second integer represent the digit given to the student

Output
Print an integer representing the count of the total number of digit present in the number excluding the given digits

Constraint
0 < number <= 10^9
0 < digit <= 9

Example
Input
56444565

Output
5

Explanation
Excluding 5; the digits in the number are 4 and 6 and their total count is 5. Hence the output is 5.
