Charlie has a magic mirror. The mirror shows right rotated versions of a given word. To generate different right-rotations of a word, write the word in a circle in clockwise order, then start reading from any given character in clockwise order till you have covered all the characters.
 
For Example:
In the word "sample", if we start with 'p', we get the right rotated word as "plesam".
There are six such right rotations of "sample" including itself.

Input Format:
He inputs to the function isSameReflection consists of two strings, word1 and word2.

Output Format:
The function returns 1 if word1 and word2 are right rotations of the same word and -1 if they are not. Both word1 and word2 will strictly contain characters between 'a-z' (lower case letters).

Useful Commands:
strlen is used to calculate the length of the string. 
The statement - int len = strlen(str); returns the length of the string str.

Testcase 1:
Input : abc,cab
Excepted return value: 1

Testcase 2:
Input : ab,aa
Excepted return value: -1
