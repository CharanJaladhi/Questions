Bob has to send a secret code S to his boss. He designs a method to enrypt the code using two key values N and M. The formula that he uses to develop the encrypted code is shown below
(((S^N % 10)^M )% 1000000007)

Write an algorithm to help Bob encrypt the code

Input
The input to the function/method consists of three arguments-
secretCode, an integer representing the secret code(S)
valueN, an integer representing the key value N
valueM, an integer representing the key value M

Output
Return an integer representing the code encrypted by Bob
