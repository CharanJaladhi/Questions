"Climate Today is a media company that provides commercial weather forecasting services. They have a list of temperatures for a particular location for N days and have already prepared the forecast report within the range L to R where L is the minimum temperature and R is the maximum temperature from the given list. Now ,"Climate Today"needs to know the temperature for the days that are not included within the range L to R.

Write an algorithm to help the company prepare the list of temperature that are not included in the range L to R.

INPUT
The first line of input consists of three integers-days,minRange,maxRange representing the number of days (N),the minimum temperature (L)and maximum temperature(R).

The second line consists of N space seperated integers-temp1,temp2,....tempN-1 representing the temperature of N days.

OUTPUT
Print space seperated integers representing the list of temperatures that are not covered in the range L to R.
  
CONSTRAINTS
 0 < days < 10^6
 -10^6 < temp1 < 10^6
 0 <= i < days
 
NOTE
Two days can have similar temperatures.

EXAMPLE
Input
7 3 6
2 5 1 8 6 9 4

Output
