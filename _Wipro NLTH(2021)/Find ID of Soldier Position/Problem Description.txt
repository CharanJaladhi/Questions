Soldier Position

There are N soldiers standing in a line with ID from 1 to N in increasing order. They are going to participate in an exercise consisting of Q actions. During the ith action, the major calls two numbers Li and Ri. The soldiers at the Lith and Rith positions interchange their places, and then soldiers at 
(Li + 1)th and (Ri - 1)th positions interchange their places and so on till (Li + m) < (Ri - m). Each of the soldiers's ID will be covered in the range [Li, Ri] for at most one action
Write an algorithm to find the ID of the soldier at Kth position in the line after all the actions are completed

Input
The first line of the input consist of 3 space separated integers - N, Q and K, representing the number of soldiers, the number of actions and the position of the soldier whose ID is required to be found after Q actions, respectively.

The next Q lines consist of two space separated integers - L and R representing the position of the soldiers initially called for the ith action

Output
Print an integer representing the ID of the kth position soldier in the line after Q actions

Constraints
1 <= K <= N <= 10^9
1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= L <= R <=
1 <= i <= Q

Example
Input
10 2 1
1 5
6 10

Output
5

Explanation
Step1: After 1st action, the position of soldiers is in the order : 5 4 3
Step2: After 2st action, the position of soldiers is in the order : 5 4
Step3: The ID of the soldier at position 1 is 5
