You are playing an online game. In the game, a number is displayed on the screen. In order to win the game, you have to count the trailing zeros in the factorial value of the given number. Write an algorithm to count the trailing zeros in the factorial value of the given number.

Input 
The input consists of an integer num, reprsenting the number displayed on the screen

Output
Print an integer representing the count of trailing zeros in the factorial of the given number

Note
The factorial of the number is calculated as the product of integer numbers from 1 to num

Example
Input
5

Output
1

Explanation
On calculating the factorial of 5, the output is 120(1*2*3*4*5). There is only one trailing 0 in 120, so the output is 1
