In a science research lab, the combination of two nuclear substances produces an initial energy A. This energy A changes at a consistent rate R every second. The energy gets multiplied by a constant value R every second. The scientist wishes to calculate the energy produced at every second if the reaction is allowed to happen for N seconds. Write an algorithm to find the energy produced at every second if the reaction is allowed to happen for N seconds. 

Input 
The input consists of three space-separated integers — initialEnergy, rate and time, representing the initial energy produced on combining the nuclear substances (A), the consistent rate of change ®, and the seconds for which the reaction is allowed to happen (N), respectively. 

Output 
Print N space-separated integers representing the energy produced at every second if the reaction is allowed to happen for N seconds. 

Constraints 
-10^6 <= InitialEnergy rate <= 10^6
0 <= time <= 100 

Example 
Input 
5 3 3  
Output 
5 15 45 
Explanation 
For N = 1, an energy of 5 is generated. 
For N = 2, a consistent rate of 3 is multiplied to it. So, it becomes 15. For N = 3, again 3 is multiplied to the previous energy value so it becomes 45. 
So, the output is 5, 15, 45.
