In an online exam, the testpaper set is categorized by the letters A to Z. The students enrolled in the exam have been assigned a numeric value called application ID. To assign the test set to the student, firstly the sum of all digits in the application ID is calculated. If the sum is within the numeric range 1-26 the corresponding alphabetic set code is assigned to the student, else the sum of the digits are calculated again and so on until the sum falls within the 1-26 range. 

Write an algorithm to display the examination set code according to the student application ID. 

Input
The input consists of an integer - applicationID, representing the numeric application ID of the student. 

Output
Print a character representing the test paper set assigned to the student. If case of no output print -1

Constraints
0 <= applicantID <= 10^9

Example 1
Input
6442

Output
p

Explanation
The sum of digits of the application ID is 16. So the output is p


Example 2
Input
558823

Output
D

Explanation
The sum of the digits of the application ID is 5+5+8+8+2+3=31
The letter that corresponds to 31 is none. Hence again the sum of digits are done

The sum of the digits are 3+1=4
The letter that corresponds to 4 is 'D'. Hence the output is 'D'
