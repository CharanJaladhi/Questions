A water reservation system constructed in a city has several opening and closing gates. If any opening gate is not closed with a corresponding closing gate then the water will leak out of the system and there will be threat of life to the people living in the city. Also, a closing gate cannot exist without an opening gate. So, the system head checks the design of the system and he has to ensure that the people are safe in the city

Write  an algorithm to find whether the people are safe or not

Input 
The input to the function/method consists of one argument
str, a string representing the sequence of gates of the water reservation system

Output
Return an integer representing the number of gates which have closing gates corresponding gates else return an integer -1
