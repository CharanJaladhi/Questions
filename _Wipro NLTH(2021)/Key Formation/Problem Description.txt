You are provided with 3 numbers: input1, input2 and input3. Each of these are four digit numbers within the range >= 1000 and <= 9999
i.e.
1000 <= input1 <= 9999
1000 <= input2 <= 9999
1000 <= input3 <= 9999
You are expected to find the key using the below formula â€“ 
Key = [SMALLEST digit in the thousands place of all three numbers] [LARGEST digit in the hundreds place of all three numbers] [SMALLEST digit in the tens place of all three numbers] [LARGEST digit in the units place of all the three numbers]
Given three numbers, write an algorithm to find the key using the above mentioned formula.

Input
The input consists of three space-separated integers â€“ input1, input2 and input3 representing the three four-digit numbers.

Output
Print an integer representing the concatenation of four digits where first digit represents the smallest digit in the thousands place of all three numbers; second digit represents the largest digit in the hundreds place of all three numbers; third digit represents smallest digit in the tens place of all three numbers and fourth digit represents the largest digit in the units place of all the three numbers.

Example
Input:
3521 2452 1352
Output:
1522
Explanation:
Key = [SMALLEST digit in the thousands place of all three numbers] [LARGEST digit in the hundreds place of all three numbers] [SMALLEST digit in the tens place of all three numbers] [LARGEST digit in the units place of all the three numbers]
If input1 = 3521, input2 = 2452, input3 = 1352, then key = [1][5][2][2] = 1522.
