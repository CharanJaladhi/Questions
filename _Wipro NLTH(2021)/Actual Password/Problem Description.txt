David and Ross both work in the same office but in different departments. David needs to share a password protected file with Ross. David made a minor change to the password so that file cannot be accessed by anyone else. He interchanged a few digits of the password and shared the new password with a hint to generate the actual password

Hint: 
Reverse all the elements from point A to point B (both A and B inclusive), where point A and B are given

Write an algorithm to reverse the elements of the password to get the actual password so that file can be opened

Input
The first line of the input consists of an integer passwordLen,  representing the number of digits in the password (N). 
The next line consists of N space separated integers passDigit[0], passDigit[1],..passDigit[N-1]   representing all digits of the password
The next line consists of two space separated integers - startPoint and endPoint representing two points A and B to reverse the elements

Output
Print N space separated
