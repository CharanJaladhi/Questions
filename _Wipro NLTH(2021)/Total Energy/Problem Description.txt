In a science research lab, the combination of two nuclear chemicals produces initail energy as X,. This energy X changes at a consistent rate R every second. The scientist wishes to calculate the total energy produced if the reaction is allowed to occur for N seconds. write an algorithm to find the total energy produced

Input
The input consists of three space separated integers - initialEnergy(X), rate and time representing the initial energy produced upon combining the nuclear chemicals the consistent rate of change and the Nth second for which the scientist wishes to calculate the total energy produced, respectively

Output
Print an integer reprsenting the total energy produced by the Nth second

Example
Input
5 3 3 

Output
24

Explanation
For N=1, an initial energy of 5 is generated.
For N=2, a consistent rate of 3 is added, so it becomes 8
For N=3, again 3 is added to previous energy value, so it becomes 11
The total energy produced after 3 seconds is 24(5+8+11)
