An architect is in charge of designing the layout of a commercial building. Triangular trusses will support the rooftop of the building. For better support of the rooftop, the architect must choose trusses with the largest area from the available stock.
The trusses are triangular frameworks whose area is given by the formula:
Area of a triangle = (base*height)/2.

Write an algorithm to help the architect find the area of the largest trusses.

Input Format
The first line of the input consists of two space-separated positive integers - b1, h1, representing the base and height of the first trusses.
The second line consists of two space-separated positive integers - b2, h2, representing the base and height of the second trusses.

Output Format
Print a real number representing the area of the largest trusses rounded up to 6 decimal places. 

Example:
Input:
4 5
6 10

Output:
30.000000

Explanation:
Area of the first triangle = 10.000000((4*5)/2).
Area of the second triangle = 30.000000((6*10)/2).
So, the output is 30.000000.
