A logic gate manufacturing company have received a gate input in an encoded form. This encoded form of the gate input is a decimal number. Since the gate accepts only binary input the company need to decode the input by converting it to binary form and then pass it through the gate.

Write an algorithm to decode the gate input.

Input
The Input consists of an integer - gateInput representing the encoded gate input.

Output
Print an integer consisting of only 0s and 1s that represents the decoded gate input.

Constraints
0 < gateInput <= 10^6 

Example
Input 
123 

Output 
1111011 

Explanation
123 in binary form is 1111011
