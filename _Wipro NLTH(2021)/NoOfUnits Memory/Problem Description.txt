The cloud computing company cloudO can accommodate various requirements for resources. The company system runs two servers. For load balancing purposes, the load of the resources gets transferred to the servers one by one. Initially, the first request goes to server 1, the next request goes to server 2, and so on. The requests served by the servers are of two types i.e., one for memory allocation(denoted by a positive number) and the other for memory deallocation (denoted by a negative number). 

Write an algorithm to find the total number of units of memory allocated/deallocated by the server 1 after processing all the requests. 

Input 
The first line of the input consists of an integer numOfReg, representing the number of requests (N). The second line consists of N space-separated integers reqi, req2 ... reqN representing the requests for the allocation/deallocation of the respective memory units. 

Output 
Return an integer representing the total number of units of memory allocated/deallocated by the server 1 after processing all the requests. 

Constraints 
0 <= num0fReq <= 10^5 
-10^6 < req < 10^6 
0 <= i <= num0fReq
