Given a m x n matrix inmatrix of positive integers, print an integer outnum based on the below logic.

-Identity all possible sets in inmatrix that contain at least fout consecutive elements of the same value val, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally

If only one set of consecutive elements is identified, store the value val in outnum

If more than one set of consecutive elements of the same value is identified either  horizontally, vertically or diagonally, print -1

Assumption
m and n will be greater than 3

Input Format
First line will contain number of rows m of inmatrix

The next m lines will contain the elements of inmatrix, each line will have n elements separated by space

Read the input from the standard input stream

Output Format
Print outnum to the standard output stream

Example 1
Input
5
0 1 6 8 8 9
5 6 1 6 8 9
6 5 6 1 1 9
1 6 6 1 1 9
6 3 3 3 3 9

Output
1

Explanation
Following elements are present consecutively atleast 4 times. Element 3 horizontally in the 5th row. Element 1 diagonally starting from the 2nd column in the first row. Element 6 diagonally starting from the 4th column in the second row. Element 9 vertically in the 6th column. As element 1 is the smallest value of the four identified sets of consecutive value, the output is 1

Example 2
Input
5
0 1 6 8 6 0
5 5 2 1 8 2
6 5 6 1 1 9
1 5 6 1 4 0
3 7 3 3 4 0

Output
-1
