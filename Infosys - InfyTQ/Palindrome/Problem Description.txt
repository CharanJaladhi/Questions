For a given positive number num, identity the palindrome formed by performing the following operations.

-Add num and its reverse 
-Check whether the sum is palindrome or not. If not, add the sum and its reverse and repeat the process until a palindrome is obtained

For example
If original integer is 195, we get 9339, as the resulting palindrome after the fourth addition

195       786        1473        5214
591       687        3741        4125
-----     --------     ---------     ---------
786      1473       5214        9339

Input Format
