Print the shortest duration between the time values given in the input array. The time values are given in the format (hour:minute:second). The time values in the array are in no particular order.

Example: 
Input : (12:34:55, 1:12:13, 8:12:15) 
output :
4:22:40 
Explanation : 
12:34:55 - 8:12:15 = 4:22:40 
12:34:55 - 1:12:13 = 11:22:42 
8:12:15 - 1:12:13= 7:0:02 
smallest Is 4:22:40 

Input format: 
The first line of the Input consists of an Integer, N that corresponds to the number of durations in the input array. 
The next N lines of the input corresponds to the durations in a given array. Assume that the duration are given in the format.
