Q2. Consider there are n positive integers representing the total number of Trains running between Station RS[0] and RS[d-1]. RS is the array containing Railway Stations in order of sequence of stations located one after another. The d represents the total number of stations. 

RS[0] and RS[d-1] are the stations at both ends. There is another array T of size d which is equal to the size of RS. T represents time in minutes between last and current station. Array positions can be mapped for RS and Tin such a way that the train will take time T[k] to reach station RS[k] from station RS[k-1]. 

N trains start at Rs[0] at different timestamps represented by float value to indicate hour value before precision point and minute value after precision point. (11.30) 

Values of RS and T are given as - 
RS[0] = PANVEL T[0] = 0 
RS[1] = KHANDESHWAR T[1] = 4 
RS[2] = MANSAROVAR T[2] = 5 
RS[3] = KHARGHAR T[3] = 3 
RS[4] = BELAPUR T[4] = 4 
RS[5] = SEAWOOD T[5] = 5 
RS[6] = NERUL T[6] = 3 

Trains is set of values representing starting times (in float) for n number of trains running from Panvel to Nerul, given as follows 

Trains = [7.30, 8.2, 12.45, 13.30, 14.44, 15.50, 9.15, 10.20, 23.59, 17.33, 19.20] 

Count the number of trains which are yet to arrive for the current day at the station where the user is present at a particular time. 

Write code to return count of trains left for the day at station name and time entered by the user. 

Note: The time is represented in 24 Hour Fashion and assume that all trains start at station RS[0]. 

Example 1:
