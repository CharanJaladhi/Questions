A group of developers generated their internal secret technique of data encode and decode. Technique for encoding is such that from the original message of text , each characters ASCII value is found and that value is added with constant value of '5' and converted back to character for that new ASCII value and provided as changed message. 

Reverse is performed for decoding, i.e. each character ASCII value is found and subtracted with constant value of '5' and converted back to character for that new ASCII value. 

Example 1: 
Input:
Hello , Sir —> String value for encoding 
sjjiytyfqp —> String value for decoding 

Output: 
Mjqqt ,Xnw —> Encoded string 
need to talk —> Decoded string 

Explanation: 
Two text messages are provided, you need to encode the First and decode the second message as per the below technique. 

Original Message " Hello , Sir" will be change to 
H - ASCII Value = 72 + 5 = 77=M 
e - ASCII value= 101+5=106=j 
l - ASCII value= 108+5=113=q
o - ASCII value= 111+5=116=t 
S - ASCII value= 83+5=88=X
i - ASCII value= 105+5=110=n 
r - ASCII value= 114+5=119=w 

Converted message "Mjqqt , Xnw"
