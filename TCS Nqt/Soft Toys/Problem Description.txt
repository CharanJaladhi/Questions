There is a shop of Soft Toys. A shopkeeper arranges the Items on the shelf for display. Customer asks for any Item randomly, either by its name or by its position number. When Customer places order, Shopkeeper removes those Items from Shelf to sale. Shopkeeper then rearranges the remaining Items on the shelf such that there is no gap left between Items (and item numbers) on the shelf. 

Items are kept in blocks on the shelf rows. Blocks are numbered from 1 to N . 
Implement suitable Data Structure with Operations to display Items in order as arranged by shopkeeper. When customer selects any Item from display, your code should remove it from list of Items and display rearranged Items. 

Consider the following list of Soft Toys and display is the format of shelf.
