You are given a function,
int Relativespeed(int direction ,int distance1 ,int time1 ,int distance2 ,int time2);

The function accepts integers 'direction','distance1','time1','distance2'&'time2'as its argument.'distance1'&'distance2' are the distances travelled and 'time1' &'time2' are the time taken by 1st &2nd person respectively. Implement the function to find 'speed1'& 'speed2' of 1st & 2nd person respectively and return the relative speed as per given conditions:
    If direction = 0, relative speed = speed1 + speed2
    If direction = 1, relative speed = speed1 + speed2

Speed = Distance/Time

Assumption:
speed1 >= speed2
distance1,time1,distance2,time2 are greater than zero.

Note:
direction is either 0 or 1.
Computed value lies within integer range.
Consider division as integer division.

INPUT:
direction: 0
distance1: 30
time1: 5
distance2: 20
time2: 10

OUTPUT:
8

Explanation:
speed1 = 30/5 = 6
speed2 = 20/10 = 2
Since direction = 0, relative speed = (6+2)=8.

Sample Input
direction: 1
distance1: 50
time1: 2
distance2: 60
time2: 3

Sample Output
5
