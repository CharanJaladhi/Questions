You are required to implement the following function:

          int Calculate(int m, int n);

The function accepts 2 positive integer ‘m’ and ‘n’ as its arguments.You are required to calculate the sum of numbers divisible both by 3 and 5, between ‘m’ and ‘n’ both inclusive and return the same.

Note: 0 < m <= n

Input 1:
m : 12
n : 50

Output 1: 
90

Explanation:
The numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, between 12 and 50 both inclusive are {15, 30, 45} and their sum is 90.

Input 2:
m : 100
n : 160

Output 2:
405
