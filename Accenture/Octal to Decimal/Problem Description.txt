You are given a function,
         int OctalToDecimal(int num);
The function takes an integer number, each of whose digits lies between 0 to 7, thus forming an octal number, as input. Implement the function to return its decimal equivalent.
The algorithm to convert the octal number to its decimal equivalent is as follows:-
1. Multiply each digit of the octal number starting with the rightmost digit
2. Moving leftwards, with increasing powers of 8 starting with 8^0.

Input:
127

Output:
87

Explanation:
While converting 127 to its decimal equivalent, we start from the right, multiplying
7 * 8^0 = 7
2 * 8^1 = 16
1 * 8^2 = 64
Adding up the results together, we get 7 + 16 + 64 = 87, which is the output.
