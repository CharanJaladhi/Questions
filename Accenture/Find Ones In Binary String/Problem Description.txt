You are given a function,
         void FindOnesInBinaryString(char* str);
The function takes a binary string i.e. a string comprising of ‘0’s and ‘1’s as input. Implement the function such that it prints the indices of the first occurrences of three equi-spaced ones, to the standard output (STDOUT).
 
 
Note:
1. Indices start from 0.
2. If no equi-spaced ‘1’s are found, then print ‘-1’

Input:
011001001000001

Output:
2 5 8

Explanation:
The distance between the ‘1’s at positions 2, 5, and 8 is 2, hence these are the indices of the first occurrence of three equi-spaced 1’s.
