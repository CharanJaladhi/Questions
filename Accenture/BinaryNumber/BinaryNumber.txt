The binary number system only uses two digits, 0 and 1. Any string that represents a number in the binary number system can be called a binary string. 

You are required to implement the following function: 
int OperationsBinaryString(char *str);

The function accepts a string 'str' as its argument. The string 'str' consists of binary digits separated with an alphabet as follows:

• 'A' denotes AND operation 
• 'B' denotes OR operation 
• 'C' denotes XOR operation 

You are required to calculate the result of the string 'str', scanning the string left to right, taking one operation at a time, and return the same. 

Note:
 • No order of priorities of operations is required.
 • Length of 'str' is odd 
 • If 'str' is NULL or None(in case python) return -1

Example: 
Input: 
str : 1COC1C1A0B1 
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
The alphabets in 'str' when expanded becomes "1 XOR 0 XOR 1 XOR I AND 0 OR 1" result of the expression becomes 1, hence 1 is returned. 

Input
str: 0C1A1B1C1C1B0A0
Output 
0
