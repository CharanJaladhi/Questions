Implement the following function:
static int CountPoints(int[] circle1, int[] circle2){}

The function accepts two arrays 'circle1' and 'circle2' of size 3. Each array is defined as {a,b,r}, where (a,b) is the center point of the circle and r is its radius, these circles lie on the positive xy-plane. Inplement the function to find and return the number of integral points that lie on or inside the common region of two circles

Circle : (a-x1)^2 + (b-y1)^2 = r^2

Assumption: circle1[0] = a, circle1[1] = b and circle1[2] = r, similarly for circle2

Note:
-Return 0 if no common pint is found
-Arrays are not null

Example:
Input:
          a b r
circle1 : 4 5 3
circle2 : 6 7 2

Output
6
