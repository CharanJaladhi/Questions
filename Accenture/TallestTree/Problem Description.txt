A treeHeight is represented by the following structure
struct TreeHeight
{
       int feets;
       int inches;
} 

You are given a function,
int TallestTree(struct TreeHeight trees[], int n);

The function accepts an array 'trees' of type 'TreeHeight' consisting of 'n' elements as its argument. 'TreeHeight' consists of two integers 'feets' and 'inches' which represents height of a tree. Implement the function to find the tallest tree among the 'trees' and return its height (in inches)

Height of a tree = (12 * feets) + inches

Assumption
 - feets > 0
 - 0 >= inches >= 11

Note
 - Computed values lies within integer range
 - Return -1 if 'trees' is null (None, in case of Python)
 - trees[0] is the first element
