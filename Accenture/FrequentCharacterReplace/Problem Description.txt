You are required to implement the following function:
char* FrequentCharacterReplaced (char* str, char x);

The function accept a string ‘str’ and a character ‘x’ as its argument.  you are required to find the most frequent character in string ‘str’ and replace it with character ‘x’  across the string and return the same

Note:
 - If frequency of two characters are same, we have to consider the character with lower ASCII value
- Character 'x' lies in the range (a-z)
- All characters in 'str' are in lowercase
-  If 'str' is Null, then return NULL, In case of python, If ‘str’ is None, then return None

Example:
Input:
str :  bbadbbababb
x: t

Output:
ttadttatatt

Explanation:
The most frequent character in string 'str' is 'b' and replacing 'b' with 't' will form string ‘ttadttatatt’, hence ’ttadttatatt’ is returned

Sample Input
str: jjkdkksjjdjf
x: y

Sample Output
yykdkksyydyf
