You are given a function
int countCoPrimes( int *arr, int length); 

The function takes two arguments , one is the array and the other one is the length of the array. Implement the function to find the number of coprimes available in the given array.
Any two numbers whose GCD is 1 are be called as co-prime.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer T, total number of elements. Then follow T elements.

Output Format:
Count the number of co-prime pairs in an array.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 25
1 <= elements <= 100

Input 1:
3
1 2 3
Output 1:
3
Here, Co-prime pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)

Input 2:
4
4 8 3 9
Output 2:
4
Here, Co-prime pairs are (4, 3), (8, 3), (4, 9 ), (8, 9 )
