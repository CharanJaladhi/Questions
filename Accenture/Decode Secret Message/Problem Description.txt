Problem statement 
Base number: 
The alphabetical order of letters is their base number, i.e, base number of A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4 and so on. 

You are given a function: 
char* DecodeMessage(char* msg); 

The function accepts a string 'msg' as its argument. 'msg' contains an encoded message, where encoded characters are seperated with a space. Implement the function to find and return the decoded message that has been encoded as follows: 

• Each letter was converted to its base number 
• A space is converted to an underscore ( _ ) 
• A number is preceded by the number symbol (#) 

Note: 
1. Return all letters in upper case 
2. Return space in decoded message only when underscore symbol (_) appears in 'msg' 
3. If 'msg' is empty or 'NULL' return NULL.

Assumptions:
1. Length of decoded string will always be less than or equal to given string length
2.Decoded message will not contain underscore ( _) and symbol(#)
