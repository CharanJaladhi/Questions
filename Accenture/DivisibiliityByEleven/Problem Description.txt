You are given a function,
int DivisibilityByEleven(int num);

The function accepts an integer 'num' as input. You have to implement the function such that it returns the number of contiguous integer fragments of 'num' that are divisible by 11. Contiguous integer fragments of a number, say 1273, are:
1, 2, 7, 3, 12, 27, 73, 127, 273 and 1273

Example
Input
1215598
