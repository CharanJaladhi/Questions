You are given a function,
           int FindLeastCommonMultiple(int num1, int num2, int num3);
The function takes three integers ‘num1’, ‘num2’, ‘num3’ as input. Implement the function to return the least common multiple of the three numbers.

Note: Least Common Multiple (LCM) of three integers x, y, z is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all three numbers x, y, and z.

Assumption: You may assume that LCM of negative numbers is the same as that of their positive equivalents.

Input:
2 3 4

Output:
12

Explanation:
The smallest number divisible by 2, 3, and 4 is 12, hence it the output.
