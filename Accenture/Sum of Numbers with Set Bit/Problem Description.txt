You are given a function,
def SumOfBitNumbers(n, set):
        The function accepts two integer 'n' and 'set' as its argument where 'n' is the number of bits and 'set' is the number of set bits. Implement the function to find the sum of all numbers possible from 'n' bits having the count of 'set' bits equal to set.

Note:
   n>0
   set>=0

Example:
Input
n : 3
set : 2
Output
14
Explanation
All possible 3 bit numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 with binary representation 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. Numbers with 2 bits set are 3, 5 and 6 summation of which is equal to 14
