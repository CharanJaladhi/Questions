Implement the following function:
char Direction(int arr[], int n);

The function accepts an integer array 'arr' of length n as its argument. Initially a man is facing 'North direction'. For every ith element in array 'arr', where 0<=j<n, the man will move according to the following rules:

->If arr[j] > 0, then the man will turn 90 degree in clockwise direction (his right side) and move forward by arr[j] meters

->If arr[j] < 0, then the man will turn 90 degree in anti-clockwise direction (his left side) and move forward by arr[j] meters

->If arr[j] < 0, then the man will retain his position

Implement the function to find the final direction the man is facing
Return the final direction as

DIRECTION         RETURN
East                             E
West                           W
North                          N
South                           S

Note:
Return '0' if array is null or NONE(in case of python)

Example:
Input:
arr : -7, 2 , 5 , 4 , -2
Output:
E
Explanation:
Initially the man is facing 'North' direction, he changes his position as,
Elements of array            Direction of man
-7			West
2			North
5			East
4			South
-2			East

East is the final direction which the man is facing.Thus the output is E
