Problem statement

You are given a function, 
int LeastDifference( int arr[], int length, int n); 

The function accepts an integer array 'arr' of size 'length' and an integer 'n' as its arguments. Implement the function to find and return the element of the array having least absolute difference with the given number 'n'

Assumption: 
Only 1 integer will have least absolute difference. 

Note:
• n >= 0 
• Absolute difference means you have to ignore the sign of the difference 

Example: 
Input: 
27 
1 2 12 13 I S 17 26 30 38 45 64 72 
Output: 
26
