In a house there is a ladder that has 11 steps. Every step is assigned with number in between 1 to 10. 

User can hop max number of steps at a time according to given number on stairs. Task is to find out minimum number of hop user can take to reach end of staircase. 

Input Format: 
Candidate has to write the code to accept 11 integer values for array A[i]. Each value is separated by new line without any additional message.

Output Format:
Written program code should generate output as single integer value represents number of hop.

For Example:
If stairs assign with below numbers:
{ 1, 3, 5, 3, 8, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Here user will hop 1st stair to 2nd stair because he/she permitted to hop only one step.
From second stair user have chance to hop maximum 3 steps directly.
 So user has option to choose 5, 3 or 8. If number 8 is chosen then the end stair 9 can be reached.
So order is 1—3—8—9. Hence Minimum 3 hop are required to reach the end of staircase.

Constraints:
1<=A[i]<=10
Size of Array A=11

Example 1 :
Input : 
1	(Value of A[0]
3	(Value of A[1]	
5	(Value of A[2]
3	(Value of A[3]
 8	(Value of A[4]
2	(Value of A[5]
 6	(Value of A[6]
7	(Value of A[7]
 6	(Value of A[8]
8	(Value of A[9]
9	(Value of A[10]
Output : 
3

Example 2 :
Input : 
1	(Value of A[0]
1	(Value of A[1]	
1	(Value of A[2]
1	(Value of A[3]
 1	(Value of A[4]
1	(Value of A[5]
 1	(Value of A[6]
1	(Value of A[7]
 1	(Value of A[8]
1	(Value of A[9]
1	(Value of A[10]
	
Output : 
10
Explanation: Every step only one hop is allowed. Hence output is 10.
