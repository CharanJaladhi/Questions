Write a program to find sum of all characters and their adjacent character combination from given string.
Consider the below string:
S1=”321”
All combination of characters and adjacent character from above string is 3,2,1,32,21,321
Addition of all number (3+2+1+32+21+321) we can get 380 as result.

Input Format: 
Candidate has to write the code to accept single string value for S1 without any additional message.
Only integer characters are allowed.

Output Format:
Written program code should generate output as single integer value which represents Sum.
Additional message in output will cause to failure of test cases.

Constraints:
String contains only number without any space.
Length of string is less than 5.

Examples:
Examples -1:
Input:
321	(Value of String S1)
Output:
380

Examples -2:
Input:
12	
Output:
15	

Explanation:
In Examples -2: All possible combinations are 1,2,12
Sum = 1+2+12=15
