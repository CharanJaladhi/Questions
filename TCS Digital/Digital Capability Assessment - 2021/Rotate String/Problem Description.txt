Consider one string as input. You have to check that given strings with single backward and forward shift are same or not. If they are same then print 1 otherwise print 0.

Hint: -
Backward Shift: 
A single circular rotation of the string in which the first character becomes the last character and all other characters are shifted one index to the left. For example, abcde becomes bcdea after one left shift.

Forward  Shift:  
A single circular rotation of the string in which the last character becomes the first character and all other characters are shifted to the right. For example, abcde becomes eabcd after one right shift
 
Input Format: 
Candidate has to write the code to accept single string value for str without any additional message.

Output Format:
Written program code should generate output as single integer value i.e. 0 or 1 which represent both forward and backward shift strings are equal or not.
Additional message in output will cause to failure of test cases.

Constraints:
String str should not allowed space, special character and numbers.
String str should only in English language.

Examples:
Examples -1:
Input: 
sfdlmnop
Output: 
0

Examples - 2:
Input: 
mama     
Output: 
1

Explanation:
In first example, string is “sfdlmnop”. 
Forward Shift:- fdlmnops
Backward Shift:- psfdlmnop
Above both strings are not equal. So output is 0.

In second example, string is “mama”.
Forward Shift:- amam
Backward Shift:- amam
Above both strings are equal. So output is 1.
