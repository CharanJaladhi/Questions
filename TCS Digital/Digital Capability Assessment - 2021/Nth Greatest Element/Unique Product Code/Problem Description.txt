In a warehouse, Items are store in the stack. Each item is assigned with some product code. Warehouse supervisor want to know that which item is being out of stock. He only wants the first product code among all product code which is left only one in the stack. 


Input Format: 
First Input-Candidate has to write the code to accept single integer value N represents total count of product.
Second Input- Second input contains N number of integer value for A[0], A[1], A[2],..A[N-1] separated by new line.

Output Format:
Written program code should generate output as single integer value which represent first unique product code.
Additional message in output will cause to failure of test cases.

Constraints:
Product code is non-negative numbers only.
If no unique product code is found then print -1.

Examples:
Assume that product codes of items are 101,103,101,102,104,103. Repeated product code is quantity of that item.

According to the above series we can find the stock of items i.e.
Product Code                  Item quantity
101			2
103			3
102			1
104			1
Here we will find that product code 102 comes first and only one quantity left in the stock.
Hence result is 102.
 
Example-1:
Input:
6	(count of all items
101	( product code of 1st item
103	( product code of 2nd item
101	( product code of 3rd item
102	( product code of 4th item
104	( product code of 5th item
103	( product code of 6th item

Output: 102

Example-2:
Input:
4	( count of all items
4021	( product code of 1st item
5056	( product code of 2nd item 
6935	( product code of 3rd item
2036	( product code of 4th item

Output:4021

Explanation:
In Example 1, total 6 product code is in list.101 and 103 are repeated twice. 102 and 104 is unique product code but 104 is second unique product code so output is 102.
In example 2, All 4 products are unique. But 4021 is first so 4021 is output.
