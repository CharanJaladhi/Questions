In an Organization there is a electronic door has been mounted at entrance gate. The door works on XOR encryption of ASCII value. The door only opens when encryption of employee code matches with database value which is already saved.
Task is to develop program for this encryption using XOR and ASCII value.

Hint: 
There are two numbers a=3 and b=4, the binary representation of 3 is 011 and of 4 is 100, so basically XOR of the same bits is 0 and for opposite bits, it is 1. In the given example 3^4, where "^" is a XOR symbol, will give us 111 whose decimal value will be 7.

Constraints:
Word must have alphabets only.
Word cannot contain space or any special character.
ASCII value is key for encryption.

Input Format
Candidate has to write the code to accept single string value for str without any additional message.

Output Format
Written program code should generate output as single integer value.
Additional message in output will cause to failure of test cases.

Examples:
Assume that word is‘Qwert’.
ASCII value of ‘Q’ is 81.
ASCII value of ‘w’ is 119.
ASCII value of ‘e’ is 101.
ASCII value of ‘r’ is 114.
ASCII value of ‘t’ is 116.
XOR of ASCII values = 81 ^ 119 ^ 101 ^ 114 ^ 116 = 69

Example-1:
Input:
Qwert

Output:
69

Example-2:
Input:
abc

Output: 96

Explanation:
Example 2, word is ‘abc’ ASCII value of ‘a’ is 97, ‘b’ is 98, ‘c’ is 99 so, XOR of ASCII values = 97 ^ 98 ^ 99 = 96
