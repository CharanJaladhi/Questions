A game development company wants to design a brain game application for kids. There are different types of tasks to be designed for the game. Among all the tasks, there is one task in which each digit of an existing number has to be replaced with another digit. Consider the following table

Existing Numbers: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Replace by             : 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Digit 0 has to be replaced with 9, 1 has to be replaced with 8, 2 has to be replaced with 7 and the rest of the numbers have to be replaced accordingly

Constraints
0<=N<=1000000
The system should generate a message as "Wrong Input" if the value of N is out of range

Example 1
Input
105201
Output
894798

Example 2
Input
10000001
Output
Wrong Input
